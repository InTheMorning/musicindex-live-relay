# Reserved Live Items Task 003: Restore On Startup And TTL Exemption

Status: Ready - 2026-09-09. Do after 002. This packet is the reason ADR 0001
exists: without it a reserved item still dies with the process or the reaper.

Every criterion in this packet is mechanical. This service has no user
interface, so it has no visual criteria and needs no operator check.

## Goal

Load reserved identity at startup so a stored broadcaster token stays valid.
Skip reserved items in the reaper.

## Files To Inspect

- `docs/adr/0001-reserved-live-items.md`
- `src/store.rs`
- `src/lib.rs` (`RelayState::new`, the reaper, the TTL configuration)
- `src/main.rs`
- `tests/api.rs`

## Files Likely To Change

- `src/store.rs`
- `src/lib.rs`
- `src/main.rs`
- `tests/api.rs`
- `README.md`
- `docs/interoperability.md`
- `systemd/musicindex-live-relay.service`

## Do Not Touch

- The wire format
- The ephemeral create route
- The admin credential check from task 002

## Constraints

- **A restored item serves `{}` until the next publish.** Never restore a
  payload, a sequence number that implies a payload, or a replay buffer. A
  restored snapshot would tell listener apps to pay the destinations of a track
  that stopped. This is the central safety rule of the ADR.
- The sequence number restarts at zero for a restored item. Say so in
  `README.md`, because an SSE client that keeps a `Last-Event-ID` sees the
  reset.
- A corrupt database is a startup error with a clear message. Do not start with
  a silent empty set, and do not delete or recreate the database.
- The reaper skips reserved items. It keeps its current behavior for ephemeral
  items.
- Startup logs the state file path and the count of restored items. It logs no
  identifier and no hash.
- `systemd/musicindex-live-relay.service` gets
  `StateDirectory=musicindex-live-relay` and `StateDirectoryMode=0700`. Added
  2026-10-04 in the review of task 002: the unit sets `ProtectSystem=strict`,
  so the relay cannot open its state file without this line.
- **The lease of ADR 0002 also applies to a reserved item.** Added
  2026-10-04, because ADR 0002 came after this packet.
  - A restored item has no snapshot, so it is not on air.
  - When the lease of a reserved item ends, `expire_leases` removes its
    snapshot as for any item. The reaper skips the item, so the item and its
    identifier stay.
  - A keepalive on a restored item with no snapshot gives
    `409 lease_expired`, as ADR 0002 says.

## Implementation Steps

1. Add `load` to the SQLite store. Read the reserved rows and return them.
   Return a typed error for a corrupt or unreadable database.
2. A missing database file is normal on a first run. Create the schema and
   yield an empty set.
3. In `RelayState::new`, build a live state for each restored record with the
   stored token hash, an empty `latest`, an empty replay buffer, `seq` at zero,
   and `last_activity` at the current time.
4. Change the reaper to retain an item when its class is `Reserved`, and to
   apply the TTL to an ephemeral item as before.
5. Fail startup on a corrupt file, with the path in the message.
6. Add tests:
   - a token that validates against a store built from the same file
   - a metadata read after a restore answers `{}` and not the old payload
   - a `remoteValue` read after a restore answers `{}`
   - a short TTL removes an ephemeral item and keeps a reserved item
   - a corrupt file fails startup and leaves the file unchanged
7. Document the restore behavior, the `{}` answer, and the sequence reset in
   `README.md`.
8. Update `docs/interoperability.md`: a reserved item survives a restart and the
   idle TTL, and it serves `{}` until the next publish.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A stored broadcaster token still validates after a restart.
- A restored item serves `{}`, never the previous payload.
- The reaper keeps reserved items and still removes ephemeral ones.
- A keepalive on a restored item gives `409 lease_expired`. A lease expiry on a
  reserved item removes its snapshot and keeps the item.
- A corrupt file fails startup with the path in the message.
- `README.md` and `docs/interoperability.md` describe the new behavior.

## Test Commands

- `cargo fmt -- --check`
- `cargo check --quiet`
- `cargo test --quiet`
- `cargo clippy --quiet -- -D warnings`

## Expected Final Report Format

1. Files changed
2. Tests run
3. Behavior changed
4. Deviations from task
5. Unresolved concerns

## Escalation Triggers

- A client depends on a sequence number that does not reset. Report it before
  you add persistence for the sequence.
- The reaper cannot read the class without a lock change that affects the
  publish path.

## Prompt for lower-context coding model

You are implementing one bounded task from a larger plan.

Implement only this task. Do not redesign the architecture.

Read:
- `docs/adr/0001-reserved-live-items.md`
- `src/store.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `tests/api.rs`

Goal:
- Restore reserved identity at startup and exempt reserved items from the
  reaper.

Constraints:
- Never restore a payload. A restored item serves `{}` until the next publish.
- The sequence number restarts at zero. Document it.
- A corrupt file fails startup and is not overwritten.
- Log the file path and the count, never an identifier or a hash.

Do not touch:
- the wire format, the ephemeral create route, the credential check

Acceptance criteria:
- Token validates after a restart, metadata answers `{}`, reaper keeps reserved
  items, corrupt file fails startup.

Test commands:
- `cargo fmt -- --check`
- `cargo test --quiet`
- `cargo clippy --quiet -- -D warnings`

At the end, report:
1. files changed
2. tests run
3. behavior changed
4. deviations from task
5. unresolved concerns
