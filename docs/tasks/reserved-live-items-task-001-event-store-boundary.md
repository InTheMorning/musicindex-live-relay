# Reserved Live Items Task 001: Event Store Boundary

Status: Implemented - 2026-10-04. See §Review Result.

Every criterion in this packet is mechanical. This service has no user
interface, so it has no visual criteria and needs no operator check.

## Goal

Add an `EventStore` boundary with an in-memory implementation, and route every
current live item read and write through it. No behavior change.

## Files To Inspect

- `docs/adr/0001-reserved-live-items.md`
- `docs/plans/adr-0001-reserved-live-items-phase-plan.md`
- `src/lib.rs` (`RelayState`, `LiveEventState`, `create_event`, the reaper)
- `tests/api.rs`

## Files Likely To Change

- `src/store.rs` (new)
- `src/lib.rs`

## Do Not Touch

- `README.md` route documentation
- The wire format of any response
- `src/main.rs`
- Any test expectation in `tests/api.rs`

## Constraints

- **This task changes no behavior.** Every existing test must pass without an
  edit. If a test needs an edit, stop and report.
- Live state stays in memory. The store holds identity and the token hash. It
  does not hold the latest snapshot, the replay buffer, or the broadcast
  sender.
- Keep the lock discipline. Do not hold a store lock across an await that sends
  to a subscriber.
- No new dependency in this task.

## Implementation Steps

1. Add `src/store.rs` and declare it in `src/lib.rs`.
2. Define `StoredEvent { event_id, token_hash, created_at, class }` where
   `class` is an enum with one variant `Ephemeral` for now.
3. Define an `EventStore` trait with `insert`, `get`, `remove`, `list_ids`, and
   `retain` for the reaper.
4. Add `MemoryEventStore` that holds the current `HashMap`.
5. Change `RelayState` to hold the store behind the same lock strategy it uses
   now.
6. Route `create_event`, the publish path, the metadata read, the
   `remoteValue` read, the SSE path, and the reaper through the store.
7. Keep `LiveEventState` as the live half. The store returns the identity, and
   `RelayState` keeps the live state beside it.
8. Add store unit tests: insert, get, remove, list, and retain.
9. Run the whole existing test file and confirm no expectation changed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `cargo test` passes with no edit to `tests/api.rs`.
- No route response changes.
- The store holds no snapshot and no replay buffer.
- `MemoryEventStore` has unit tests for all five operations.

## Test Commands

- `cargo fmt -- --check`
- `cargo check --quiet`
- `cargo test --quiet`
- `cargo clippy --quiet -- -D warnings`

## Expected Final Report Format

1. Files changed
2. Tests run
3. Behavior changed
4. Deviations from task
5. Unresolved concerns

## Escalation Triggers

- An existing test needs an edit. That means behavior changed. Stop.
- The trait cannot express the reaper without holding a lock for too long.

## Prompt for lower-context coding model

You are implementing one bounded task from a larger plan.

Implement only this task. Do not redesign the architecture.

Read:
- `docs/adr/0001-reserved-live-items.md`
- `src/lib.rs`, `tests/api.rs`

Goal:
- Add an `EventStore` trait and `MemoryEventStore`, and route current reads and
  writes through it.

Constraints:
- No behavior change. Every existing test passes unedited.
- The store holds identity and token hash only. No snapshot, no replay buffer.
- No new dependency.

Do not touch:
- route documentation, response shapes, `src/main.rs`, test expectations

Acceptance criteria:
- `cargo test` passes with no test edit.
- Store unit tests cover insert, get, remove, list, and retain.

Test commands:
- `cargo fmt -- --check`
- `cargo test --quiet`
- `cargo clippy --quiet -- -D warnings`

At the end, report:
1. files changed
2. tests run
3. behavior changed
4. deviations from task
5. unresolved concerns

## Review Result

Reviewed 2026-10-04. The review changed no code. No test expectation changed,
and `tests/api.rs`, `README.md`, `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` have no diff.

- The keepalive and `expire_leases` also go through the store. ADR 0002 came
  after this packet.
- The lock order of the lease review stays. The table lock is released before
  the first event lock. `expire_leases` checks the lease again under the event
  write lock, and the keepalive renews under the event read lock. No lock is
  held across an emit.
- The module `store` is public, because clippy rejects the unused `remove`
  in a private module. ADR 0001 task 004 uses it.
- The trait methods return no `Result`. Task 002 adds the SQLite store, so it
  must change the trait to return `Result`, or wrap the store.
