# Reserved Live Items Task 002: Reserved Class And Admin Credential

Status: Implemented - 2026-10-04. See §Review Result.

Every criterion in this packet is mechanical. This service has no user
interface, so it has no visual criteria and needs no operator check.

## Goal

Add the reserved item class, an admin credential in configuration, and a route
that reserves a durable live item. Write identity to a file.

## Files To Inspect

- `docs/adr/0001-reserved-live-items.md`
- `src/store.rs`
- `src/lib.rs` (`AppConfig`, `create_event`, `hash_token`, the token check)
- `tests/api.rs`
- `README.md`

## Files Likely To Change

- `src/store.rs`
- `src/lib.rs`
- `tests/api.rs`
- `README.md`
- `docs/interoperability.md`

## Do Not Touch

- The behavior of `POST /v1/liveitems`
- The publish path and the wire format
- The reaper. Task 003 changes it

## Constraints

- **`POST /v1/liveitems` does not change.** A public route must not write to
  disk.
- The reserve route needs the admin credential. Compare it in constant time
  with `subtle`, in the shape of the broadcaster token check. Never compare
  with `==`.
- With no admin token configured, the reserve route answers `404`. The feature
  is off by default.
- **No payload reaches disk.** The file holds identity and token hash only.
- SQLite owns its own durability. Do not write the database through a
  temporary file and a rename. Use a transaction for each change.
- Never log the admin token and never log a broadcaster token.
- A reserved item returns its broadcaster token once, exactly as an ephemeral
  item does.

## Implementation Steps

1. Add `Reserved` to the class enum in `src/store.rs`, and add a `label` field
   to `StoredEvent`.
2. Add `SqliteEventStore` that keeps the reserved records in a SQLite file and
   holds ephemeral records in memory. The schema holds `event_id`,
   `token_hash`, `label`, `created_at`, and a class column. Add a schema
   version table so the identity work that follows can migrate it.
3. Add configuration values: an admin token, a state file path, and a maximum
   reserved item count. Read all three from the environment with the existing
   helper. The admin token and the state path are optional. The state path
   default is the systemd `StateDirectory`, which is
   `/var/lib/musicindex-live-relay/` for the packaged unit.
4. Add `POST /v1/liveitems/reserved`:
   - require the admin credential in an `Authorization` header
   - accept an optional `label` in the body
   - make an identifier and a token, store the hash, write the file
   - return the same response shape as the ephemeral create, plus the label
5. Return `401` for a missing credential, `403` for a wrong credential, and
   `404` when no admin token is configured.
6. Add tests: reserve with a correct credential, a wrong credential, a missing
   credential, no configured admin token, a duplicate label, and a publish to a
   reserved item with its broadcaster token.
7. Add a test that the state file holds no payload field.
8. Document the route, the two configuration values, and the status codes in
   `README.md`.
9. Add the new death-mode information to `docs/interoperability.md`: a reserved
   item survives a restart, and an ephemeral item does not.

## Contract With v4vmm

`v4vmm` reads this response into `LiveItemCreateResponse` in `src/api.rs`. A
renamed or absent required field fails that parse, and the operator sees a
transport error with no cause. Hold these names.

```json
{
  "event_id": "01J8Z...",
  "broadcaster_token": "...",
  "metadata_url": "https://relay.example/v1/liveitems/01J8Z.../metadata",
  "events_url": "https://relay.example/v1/liveitems/01J8Z.../events",
  "remote_value_url": "https://relay.example/...",
  "socket_io_url": "https://relay.example/...",
  "label": "weekly show"
}
```

- `event_id`, `broadcaster_token`, `metadata_url`, and `events_url` are
  required. `v4vmm` fails the whole parse without any one of them.
- `remote_value_url` and `socket_io_url` are optional, and absent is not `null`.
- `label` is new in this packet. `v4vmm` ignores a field it does not know, so
  adding it breaks nothing.
- The token appears once, in this response. No later read returns it.

Status codes, because the caller separates these without reading text:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 201 | reserved, and the body holds the token |
| 401 | no credential |
| 403 | wrong credential |
| 404 | no admin token is configured, so the feature is off |
| 409 | the label is already reserved |

**`404` means the feature is off, not that the route is missing.** A caller that
reads `404` as "this relay is too old" is correct either way, and both answers
lead the operator to the same place.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The response holds the four required field names that `v4vmm` parses, and
  the token appears only there.
- The five status codes are distinct, and `404` means the feature is off.

- The ephemeral create route behaves exactly as before.
- The reserve route is unavailable with no admin token configured.
- The credential check is constant time.
- The state file holds identity and hash only.
- `README.md` documents the route and the status codes.

## Test Commands

- `cargo fmt -- --check`
- `cargo check --quiet`
- `cargo test --quiet`
- `cargo clippy --quiet -- -D warnings`

## Expected Final Report Format

1. Files changed
2. Tests run
3. Behavior changed
4. Schema created
5. Deviations from task
6. Unresolved concerns

## Escalation Triggers

- SQLite needs a crate choice that the plan did not name. Report the crate and
  why.
- The response shape cannot carry a label without a change that affects an
  existing client.

## Prompt for lower-context coding model

You are implementing one bounded task from a larger plan.

Implement only this task. Do not redesign the architecture.

Read:
- `docs/adr/0001-reserved-live-items.md`
- `src/store.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `tests/api.rs`

Goal:
- Add the reserved class, an admin credential, and `POST /v1/liveitems/reserved`
  with a durable identity file.

Constraints:
- Do not change `POST /v1/liveitems`. A public route must not write to disk.
- Constant-time credential compare. Never log a token.
- No payload in the database. Identity and token hash only.
- SQLite with a schema version table. One transaction for each change.
- No admin token configured means the route answers `404`.

Do not touch:
- the publish path, the wire format, the reaper

Acceptance criteria:
- Ephemeral behavior unchanged, credential cases tested, file holds no payload.
- `README.md` documents the route and the status codes.

Test commands:
- `cargo fmt -- --check`
- `cargo test --quiet`
- `cargo clippy --quiet -- -D warnings`

At the end, report:
1. files changed
2. tests run
3. behavior changed
4. schema created
5. deviations from task
6. unresolved concerns

## Review Result

Reviewed 2026-10-04. The review changed no code. The 22 present tests in
`tests/api.rs` have no change, and 14 new tests cover the route.

The review accepts these deviations:

- Only the write methods of the store return `Result`. Both stores answer the
  reads from memory.
- The SQLite file decides the label check and the count check, because no
  restore exists before task 003.
- The admin token has its own parser, so a configuration error never shows its
  value. The relay keeps only its hash.
- The route also gives `400`, `413`, `500` and `503`. The five codes of the
  contract keep their meaning.
- `AGENTS.md` §Current State changed with this task, because it must describe
  the present.

Points for the next tasks:

- A reserve holds the table write lock during one SQLite commit, in
  `spawn_blocking`. No runtime thread blocks, and no event lock is held.
- The reaper still deletes a reserved row synchronously. Task 003 removes this
  path, because the reaper then skips reserved items.
- Between task 002 and task 003, a restart drops a reserved item from memory,
  but its row stays.
- `systemd/musicindex-live-relay.service` has no `StateDirectory`. Task 003
  adds it.
